        "Explanation: To put it another way, TF-IDF calculates a word's weight in a document based on how frequently it appears across the entire corpus. Words that appear frequently in a document but infrequently in the corpus are given greater weights.\n",
        "Reason: TF-IDF facilitates the capture of word uniqueness inside a document. Highly specialized words, like \"excellent\" or \"awful,\" will contribute more to the sentiment classification and have higher TF-IDF scores.\n",
        "\n",
        "Word Embeddings:\n",
        "Explanation: Word embeddings capture the semantic relationships between words by representing them as dense vectors in a continuous vector space.\n",
        "Reason: Word embeddings help the classifier comprehend the relationships between words by capturing semantic meaning and context. This can assist in collecting sentiment nuances that might not be discernible from word frequency analysis alone.\n",
        "\n",
        "N-grams:\n",
        "Explanation: In a document, N-grams are collections of n consecutive words.\n",
        "Reason: Sentiment analysis can benefit from the syntactic and local context that N-grams collect. N-grams are useful for capturing subtleties in language, as phrases like \"not good\" or \"very happy\" may convey a different meaning than single words alone.\n",
